## RAKsmart Introduction

RAKsmart operates out of San Jose, California, right in the heart of Silicon Valley. They've built their reputation on providing solid hosting infrastructure across multiple continents. What started as a dedicated server provider has grown into a full-service hosting company offering everything from basic VPS plans to enterprise-grade bare metal servers.

Their infrastructure spans more than 30 global locations including Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, Seattle, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea, and Frankfurt. This geographic diversity means you can pick a data center close to your users, which translates to better performance and lower latency.

The company has earned its Secure Hosting Alliance certification, showing they take security seriously. They've also built out a 10 Tbps backbone network with over 1 Tbps of DDoS mitigation capacity, which is substantial protection against attacks that could take your site offline.

What sets RAKsmart apart is their flexibility. Whether you need a budget VPS for a personal project or a custom-configured dedicated server for enterprise workloads, they've got options. They support both bandwidth-based and traffic-based billing, which gives you more control over costs depending on your usage patterns.

## RAKsmart Reviews

Customer feedback about RAKsmart tends to focus on a few key areas that potential buyers should consider.

**Performance and Reliability**
Users report consistent performance from RAKsmart's infrastructure. The 99.9% uptime SLA is generally met, and the high-specification hardware delivers solid results for both basic hosting and demanding applications. The network quality, particularly for users targeting Asian markets, receives positive feedback thanks to China-optimized routes and CN2 GIA connectivity.

Multiple data center locations allow customers to strategically place their infrastructure closer to end users. This geographic flexibility is frequently mentioned as a major advantage, especially for businesses serving international audiences.

**Network and Connectivity**
RAKsmart's network engineering is a standout feature. Their peering with tier-1 ISPs, CDN providers, and cloud platforms creates stable, low-latency connections. Users appreciate the premium network mix including CN2 GIA, PCCW, and NTT with direct peering. This makes a real difference for applications where performance is critical.

The availability of DDoS protection up to 1 Tbps provides significant security. While basic protection is included, additional tiers are available for purchase. Users dealing with frequent attacks find this valuable, though the DDoS protection does add to the overall cost.

**Pricing and Value**
Reviews consistently note that RAKsmart's pricing is competitive, especially for dedicated servers and bandwidth-intensive services. The flash sales, particularly the E3-1230 server at $30/month with locked renewal pricing, are called out as exceptional deals.

VPS plans starting at under $3/month provide entry-level access to solid infrastructure. The ability to scale resources easily through the control panel means you can start small and grow as needed.

The recharge bonus promotions effectively lower overall costs. If you can take advantage of a 2x or 3x credit bonus, it significantly reduces your per-month expenses.

**Customer Support**
RAKsmart provides 24/7 support in both English and Chinese. Support channels include live chat, email, ticket system, and phone. Response times are generally reasonable, though some users note that highly technical inquiries can take longer to resolve.

The ticket system receives praise for accurately recording and tracking complex technical problems. The knowledge base and documentation help users resolve common issues independently.

**Control Panel and Management**
The customer center interface is described as sleek and functional. Users can order hosting packages, manage billing, track services, and handle most administrative tasks through the portal. The management backend supports elastic scaling, IP additions, and other configuration changes without significant downtime.

Some reviewers mention that the main website could be more descriptive and easier to navigate when initially researching products. It's worth spending time to understand the specific configuration options available for your chosen service.

**Areas for Improvement**
While reviews are largely positive, users note a few areas where RAKsmart could improve. The lack of a money-back guarantee is mentioned by some reviewers who prefer to have that safety net when trying a new provider. Product descriptions on the website sometimes lack detail, requiring direct contact with sales to clarify specifications.

The shared hosting service line is relatively new compared to their VPS and dedicated offerings, so there's less customer feedback available for those products. If you're considering shared hosting, it makes sense to start with a short-term commitment while you evaluate the service.

**Who RAKsmart Works Best For**
Based on user feedback, RAKsmart is particularly well-suited for:
- Businesses targeting Asian markets who need China-optimized networking
- High-traffic websites and applications requiring substantial bandwidth
- Multi-region deployments needing global infrastructure
- Users who need customizable hardware configurations
- Resellers and agencies managing infrastructure for multiple clients
- Gaming servers, streaming platforms, and other latency-sensitive applications

For basic personal websites or small projects, RAKsmart's VPS offerings provide solid value, though you should compare carefully against other budget VPS providers to ensure you're getting the best fit for your specific needs.
